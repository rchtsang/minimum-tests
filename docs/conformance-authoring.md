# Conformance Authoring

This guide explains how to add focused guest evidence to `minimum-tests`. The
canonical
[platform specifications](https://github.com/rchtsang/minemu/blob/main/docs/platform/abi-v1.md)
define requirements, and the parent
[headless-testing reference](https://github.com/rchtsang/minemu/blob/main/docs/dev/headless-testing.md)
defines every manifest field and comparison rule.

## Suite Layers

The baseline under `image/` packages the starter kernel and one user module. Its
RAM prefill proves that reset firmware replaces initialized data and clears BSS
instead of relying on reset-zero RAM. The kernel validates boot info and the
higher-half handoff before emitting success value `0x20000001`.

Focused cases under `headless/` isolate one contract area:

| Case | Primary evidence |
|---|---|
| `uart` | Polling, RX queues, TX output, and both ports |
| `interrupts` | Timer deadlines, source levels, priority, claim/EOI, and IRQ entry |
| `block` | Two-unit DMA, snapshotting, shared IRQ/Busy state, write-back media, and persistence |
| `block-unattached` | Scheduled No Media completion for a supported unattached unit |
| `rng-trace` | Deterministic RNG sequence and ordered trace events |
| `mmu` | PTE permissions, Accessed/Dirty bits, and translation faults |
| `exceptions` | SVC, undefined, aborts, IRQ state, CP15, and user/device protection |
| `ttbr-switch` | TTBR0 replacement and explicit TLBIALL behavior |

## Case Anatomy

Each `headless/NAME/` directory contains:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Makefile` | Sets `PROGRAM := NAME` and includes `../case.mk` |
| `main.c` | Guest checks, trace diagnostics, final success event, and fail-stop |
| Optional `*.S` | Exact instruction sequences or custom exception trampolines |
| `image.toml` | Packages `build/NAME.elf` as the case kernel |
| `test.toml` | Sets the deadline/setup and exact host assertions |

`kernel/common.mk` discovers every directory-local `.c` and `.S` file, links it
with the shared kernel runtime and linker script, and writes all generated files
under the case's `build/` directory. Shared startup establishes banked stacks,
bootstrap page tables, TTBR0, the MMU, VBAR, and the high-half transition before
calling `minemu_kernel_main`.

Default weak exception handlers enter `minemu_fail_stop()`. A case may override
the C dispatch hooks or provide trampolines when the exception transition itself
is under test.

## Create A Case

1. Create `headless/NAME/`.
2. Add this `Makefile`:

   ```make
   PROGRAM := NAME
   include ../case.mk
   ```

3. Add `main.c` and any assembly sources.
4. Add this `image.toml`:

   ```toml
   kernel = "build/NAME.elf"
   ```

5. Add `test.toml` with `image`, `boot_rom`, a finite `max_ticks`, lifecycle and
   MMU expectations, and exact `trace_values`.
6. Emit a unique final success value, then call `minemu_fail_stop()`.
7. Add `NAME` to `CASES` in `headless/Makefile`.
8. Implement a phony `prepare` target if the case needs disposable host state.
9. Run the case directly, all focused cases, then root `make test`.

Registration is mandatory. An unregistered directory can run directly but is
absent from aggregate image, test, and clean targets.

## Guest Assertions

Use `MINEMU_REQUIRE(condition, code)` from
`kernel/include/minemu/conformance.h`. It evaluates the condition once. On
failure it emits:

```text
0xf0000000 | (code & 0x0fffffff)
```

and enters `minemu_fail_stop()`. Only the low 28 code bits are meaningful. Keep
codes unique within a case so an unexpected trace identifies the failed guest
condition.

The fail-stop routine does not exit the emulator. It spins until the manifest's
virtual-time deadline pauses execution. Unexpected exceptions normally enter a
weak fail-stop handler and are detected because the expected success trace is
missing.

## Trace Oracle Convention

Current cases reserve these value classes:

| Range/prefix | Use |
|---|---|
| `0x2.......` | Success/progress values expected by the manifest |
| `0xe.......` | Case-specific contextual failure diagnostics |
| `0xf.......` | `MINEMU_REQUIRE` failures |

The baseline retains older `0xb007bad0`/`0xb007bad1` diagnostics. New focused
cases should use the shared convention.

`trace_values` compares the complete retained trace-value sequence exactly,
including order, duplicates, and length. It is not a contains check. Therefore:

- A `MINEMU_REQUIRE` failure adds an unexpected `0xf.......` value.
- A timeout or unhandled exception omits the final success value.
- Extra diagnostics or duplicate success values fail the host assertion.
- The success marker must be the final guest trace event.

Do not emit trace events after the expected success sequence. The host retains
the trace subset of a bounded 4,096-event global history, so cases should remain
small and purpose-specific.

## Tick Budgets

`max_ticks` is a hard observation window, not a guest exit time. Choose a value
large enough for firmware, bootstrap, and the case to finish on all supported
hosts. The value does not make a slow host fail because it is virtual time.

Most current focused cases use 500,000 ticks. `exceptions` uses 600,000 and
`interrupts` uses 900,000. The baseline uses 500,000. Keep a larger budget only
when the guest behavior requires more virtual progress.

Set `instruction_batch = 1` only when the case intentionally probes exact
instruction/device boundaries or benefits from maximal boundary visibility.
The block and interrupt deadline cases use it with explicit assembly sequences.
Batch size does not weaken exact scheduled-input or `max_ticks` enforcement.

Focused manifests normally assert:

```toml
[assert]
execution_lifecycle = "paused"
shutdown_lifecycle = "stopped"
mmu_enabled = true
trace_values = [0x20080001]
```

Use a case-specific success value that does not collide with existing cases.

## Scripted UART Input

Use `[[inputs]]` for deterministic input:

```toml
[[inputs]]
at_tick = 0
uart = 0
data = "hello"
```

Port must be 0 or 1. Data is delivered as UTF-8 bytes. Tick-0 input is available
before the first execution batch. Entries at equal ticks retain manifest order;
later entries are delivered at their exact emulator-thread boundary. Keep each
input within the 4,096-byte UART RX capacity unless overflow is the behavior
under test.

## Disposable Block Media

Never rely on media left by a previous run. The block case overrides the common
empty `prepare` target:

```make
.PHONY: prepare
prepare:
	mkdir -p build
	rm -f build/filesystem.img build/swap.img
	truncate -s 1024 build/filesystem.img
	truncate -s 1024 build/swap.img
```

`case.mk` makes `prepare` and the packaged image prerequisites of test execution.
The manifest attaches the resulting two-sector images with `block0_media` and
`block1_media`, then selects each assertion's unit and checks persisted bytes at
host-file offset 512 after shutdown. The legacy `block_media` field remains a
unit-0 alias. `make image` alone does not prepare media; `make test` does. Place
every disposable fixture under `build/` so aggregate clean removes it.

## Run And Diagnose

```sh
# One case directly.
make -C headless/uart test

# One registered case through the aggregate Makefile.
make -C headless test-uart

# Build one image without execution.
make -C headless image-uart

# All focused cases, excluding baseline.
make -C headless test

# Baseline only, including Boot ROM check.
make -C image test

# Baseline followed by every registered focused case.
make test
```

Pass `MINEMU=/path/to/minemu` to any command when the desired executable is not
on `PATH`. A focused-only run does not rebuild/compare the canonical Boot ROM;
use root `make test` for complete release evidence.

When a case fails, inspect the reported expected/actual trace vector first. A
`0xf.......` value identifies a `MINEMU_REQUIRE` code, a contextual `0xe.......`
value identifies a case-defined failure path, and a missing success value usually
means an exception, hang, or insufficient budget.
